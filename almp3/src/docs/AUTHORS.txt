Peter Wang      - Made the example program and ported it to Linux

Jason Winnebeck - Made the first port to Microsoft Visual C++

Nick Sumner     - Fixed a bug that prevented MP3s from being played

David Dribin    - Fixed some bugs related with the returning of position
                  in bytes of the mp3streams and helped to fix some
                  issues with the mp3 validation

Bruno Dupuis    - Changed the source so it wouldn't complain if the last
                  frame of a MP3 was wrong.
