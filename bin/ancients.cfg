Oh thankyou for rescuing me! I'll return to the Oracle chamber immediately.
No sweat, oh guardian of wisdom!
Sounds like a plan, oh Bearded One!
No problemo.
Great. You know, you look a lot like the last guy I rescued...
Good idea, Gramps.
May the road rise to meet your feet, Mr. Member.
Wise plan of action, your ancientness.
You're the last one, fella. Let's both get back to the Oracle chamber!
